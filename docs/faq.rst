Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Does this extension work with Read the Docs?
--------------------------------------------

Yes.

Read the Docs should detect the ``404.html`` page generated by the extension automatically,
and serve it when a user hits a not found page.

If you are using a Single Version project,
you may want to set :confval:`notfound_urls_prefix` to ``None``.


Does this extension work with GitHub pages?
-------------------------------------------

Yes.

You may want to set :confval:`notfound_urls_prefix` to ``None``,
and then add ``permalink: /404.html`` in the `YAML front matter`_.

If you are using the github provided domain, make sure to set the :confval:`notfound_urls_prefix` to your repository's name in between two forward slashes. For example if your repository is named ``MyRepo``, then ``notfound_urls_prefix = "/MyRepo/"``.

Does this extension work with `Jupyter Book <https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html>`_?
-------------------------------------------

Yes.

You will need to install the extension locally and add it to your Jupyter Book ``_config.yml`` as an extra extension, and you will likely need to set the :confval:`notfound_urls_prefix` to your repository's name in between two forward slashes. For example if your repository is named ``MyRepo``, then ``notfound_urls_prefix = "/MyRepo/"``.

To see an example of a Jupyter Book ``_config.yml`` file that works with sphinx-notfound-page, see:

Why is my local web server not showing a 404.html?
--------------------------------------------------

Simple web servers, such as ``http.server``, don't have a default handler for 404
codes, so it doesn't know to point to the generated ``404.html``.

To see an example of adding a custom request handler for 404 codes, see:
